# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùì
Here you'll find a list of frequently asked or quite obvious questions you might have about this page. Obviously, this will be expanded over time since there's no <em>frequently</em> asked questions before publishing the page for the first time.

## Why did you create this?
My primary goal in creating this website was both to educate the general public about the current states and future ventures of space technology and to expand on a book I wrote while I was a student in university. In the course of that, I had already covered some of the chapters preserved in this website, but felt they could use some revision and polishing.

Space Exploration is my biggest interest anyway, along with the technology sector as such, which is why I personally found a lot of fun in developing this site.

## Do you work in this field?
Not yet. As most of us, my life up to this point didn't go in a straight and predictable line and I bumped into a lot of issues that delayed me getting into astrophysics / aerospace engineering. I'm currently working as a software developer but I'm planning to
go back to university and study aerospace engineering in Germany. This isn't a dream or a plan B or anything that's uncertain since I cannot imagine any topic I could be more passionate about than this. Ever since I broke out in tears watching the Falcon 9 boosters land successfully
for the first time I knew there was no place for me to call home than this field and that's where I'm heading.

## How can I contribute?
If you want to propose a topic or chapter, go ahead and shoot me a DM on discord, an email or an issue on this project's GitHub repo. Obviously, if you want to add a topic or chapter, you should have very good reasons to, so please be as specific and detailed as possible
about why this should be added. It's crucial for you to be able to provide sources for your reasonings or atleast explain them very rationally for me to consider them because that's exactly what it takes for me to consider my own ideas. 

As soon as we're done talking about the details of your idea, you can go ahead and:

- Fork <strong>[this repository](https://github.com/gianlucajahn/guidetothegalaxy)</strong>
- Clone it to your local environment
- Create a new branch and name it after your topic or chapter
- Add your content
- Commit and push your changes
- Create a Pull Request to this project's repository

I will then go ahead and review it. If all fits, it will be merged and you'll be listed as one of our contributors! ü•≥
