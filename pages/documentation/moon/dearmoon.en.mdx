# Dear Moon Mission

## Civilian spaceflight
The latest step towards civilian spaceflight certainly was the <strong>[Inspiration4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspiration4)</strong> mission initiated by Jared Isaacman together with SpaceX. A group of all civilians, four in total, have been launched into space in a dragon capsule around Earth. Now, the dearMoon mission will be the next arguably small step towards making spaceflight more accessible to the general public:

Together with japanese billionaire Yusaka Maezawa, eight civilians set out on SpaceX Starship for a six day long trip around the moon. Maezawa's goal is to inspire people and to create awareness for the possibility of space tourism, hopefully increasing the interest and attention it gets from the general public. The mission is set to be launched within the fourth quarter of 2024.
