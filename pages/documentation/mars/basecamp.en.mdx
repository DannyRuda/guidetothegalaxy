# Basecamp on Mars

## First Cargo Trips

Depending on wether you have read the previous chapter, you might now roughly know how the rockets we're sending to Mars work and you definitely understand the basic features and utility of a rocket. Having that out of the way, what are we going to do once we land on Mars?

First of all, the first Starships to land on Mars are probably going to be unmanned. For humans to survive on Mars, it is necessary for life support systems to run properly, so the first cargo trips to Mars are probably going to be made to lay down a foundation for life support and fuel production systems. 

Once that's done, the first manned Starships will be able to make their way to Mars.
