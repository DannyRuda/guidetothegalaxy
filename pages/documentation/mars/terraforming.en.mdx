# Terraforming Mars
What is it and how would it work? Can we do it at all?

## Baseline of things
Now, assuming the marsian population didn't collapse due to an epidemic, technical difficulties, cultural clashes, war or a rogue AI taking over, we still die once we leave our housing modules, no matter how big the city. You could build domes and fill them with parks and grassy fields, but that would be a huge effort and Mars would still be a place too dangerous to live in for the general public. Let's try and solve that.

## What is terraforming?
Terraforming means changing the environment of a planet or moon to make it like Earth so that humans and other Earth-based life forms can live there. This involves altering the planet's atmosphere, surface, and climate to create a habitable environment. The goal is to create a new home for humans and other living beings in space.

In the context of Mars, we would do that by introducing greenhouse gases to the marsian atmosphere to warm it up so that the poles melt and water gets re-liquefied. 

## How to terraform Mars?
Admittedly, finding this out has been the most time-consuming part of my research for this project. Many have been presented, few have been fleshed out, and even more rarely has evidence been provided.
I couldn't find a concept that actually worked efficiently enough for me, which is why I have prepared my own - a combination of various suggestions - for you. Much of the concept comes by James Lovelock, who first presented his in 1984. Of course you can find more sources in the source list.

### What we have to do
To be able to determine the necessary outcome of our terraforming process, we'll have to assess what is currently preventing life from surviving on Mars. As of right now, the marsian atmosphere doesn't support liquid water because the atmospheric pressure is below the <strong>[triple point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_point)</strong>, preventing anything from existing in a liquid state. Plants and animals also need oxygen, but micro-organisms are relatively easy to satisfy, so we might use micro-organisms to <strong>create</strong> oxygen for us. More on that later.
