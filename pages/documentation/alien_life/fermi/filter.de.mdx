## Das Konzept
Der Große Filter ist die Idee, dass es irgendwo auf der Kardaschow-Skala, ohne weitere Annahmen darüber zu machen, wo das sein könnte, ein Ereignis gibt, das im Allgemeinen in der Entwicklung jeder intelligenten Spezies auftritt und alle oder zumindest die meisten von ihnen auslöscht. 

Der Große Filter ist eine von vielen möglichen Erklärungen für das Fermi-Paradoxon, und darin eine sehr elegante, denn er versucht nicht, die ständige Abwesenheit von außerirdischem Leben zu erklären, sondern bricht es in nichts weiter als eine Asynchronität herunter.

Wenn du dem letzten Absatz nicht ganz folgen konntest, möchte ich es etwas praktischer erklären: Es mag eine Menge vielversprechender Planeten geben, auf denen intelligentes Leben entstehen könnte, aber das Universum existiert auch schon seit einer wahnsinnig langen Zeit. Wenn es einen großen Filter gäbe, der jede außerirdische Zivilisation nach, sagen wir, 5.000 Jahren auslöscht, könnte man keine kosmischen Spuren von ihnen finden, und nach nur einer halben Million Jahren, einem Wimpernschlag auf der kosmischen Zeitachse, könnte man nicht einmal erahnen, dass es sie jemals gegeben hat, wenn man auf ihrem Heimatplaneten steht. 

So, if there is a great filter, maybe right in front of us, despite it being pretty depressing, it would atleast explain the absence of Type 2 civilization monuments around our galaxy, because no civilization came far enough to build them. Let us explore the possible filters we might already have or might still have to overcome.

## The probability for life

It might just be that life as we know it is much more improbable than we think it is. This could mean a lot of different things: Simple prokaryotic single-cell life, complex eukaryotic life or reproductive molecules at all. Even if that takes place on many planets, the emergence of intelligent life might be very rare still. 

Actually, I imagine this to be the most probable scenario, since it happened once on Earth, many thousands of years ago, and it never happened again. As the biologist Ernst Mayr already said: There have perhaps been as many as 50 billion species since the origin of life and only one of these achieved the kind of intelligence needed to establish a civilization.

## Nuclear Wars 
As we all sadly had to experience not too long ago, humans have not entirely passed the stage of nuclear threats yet, indicating other species may have struggled with them, either. After all, extinction by nuclear war is a very tricky potential filter because it would only require two big countries with a lot of nuclear material - e.g. russia and the US - to attack each others with them, which would probably take just a couple of hours for both to be reduced to inhabitable wastelands while additionally threatening life in surrounding countries.

<strong>If</strong> many species make it up to this point, I myself am very convinced we have lost lots of intelligent species to nuclear wars. I have to admit, this thought is pretty depressing.

## Artificial intelligence
Another topic that has had it's hot takes and breakthroughs in the last couple of years and will certainly continue to deliver in the near future: Artificial Intelligence. Of all the possible great filters, this luckily is the one being discussed most often and the most popularized - thanks to Keanu Reeves' breathtaking performance in "The Matrix".

</figure>

For real, though,  Artifical Intelligence systems built to solve any given problem could just rightfully come to the conclusion that humanity is a contributing factor to it and erase them from the surface of the Earth. The possible threat through an intelligence explosion in AI and the emergence of a rogue AI is taken seriously enough by some influencial people for them to have signed an <strong>[open letter urging a pause on AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-musk-risks.html)</strong>, among them being Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Stuart Russell and Max Tegmark.

Due to AI being an intriguingly promising way to increase our quality of life however, the open letter doesn't ask for a permanent halt but just a 6 month timeframe of no further progress being made for sufficient regulations to be put into place. So, after all... This filter might still come into play. Not trying to jinx it.

## Watcher civilization(s)
As mentioned earlier, one possible explanation for us to see no other prospering intelligent life in our galaxy might be watcher civilizations being around. The concept of a watcher civilization revolves around a hypothetical Type 3+ civilization that - for reasons beyond our comprehension - does not want other intelligent lifeforms to emerge in their territory, which is why they wipe them out as soon as they advance far enough. 

In the context of a hypthetical watcher civilization being around, it would also make sense for us to not find any traces of alien life even if they didn't manage to wipe out all of their competition: Any surviving species would have every reason to hide themselves from other's radars, which would obviously make it hard for us to get in touch with alien life without being reduced to atoms.

## Summary
Wherever the great filters lie, it's save to say we made it pretty far already. After all, we already shot satellites, probes and space stations into space so even in the eventual case of sudden death, we leave some traces behind for others to find. Now that we know what alien life would be up to and what could make them unlikely to be around, we are able to come up with lots of possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox!
