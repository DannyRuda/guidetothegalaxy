This bad boy is supposed to be the flagship of human space exploration for a while now, huh? <br />
Let's give it a closer look.

## Fundamentals
SpaceX' Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy Booster represent a fully and rapidly reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond.
I did great copy-pasting that from their website, did I? Jokes aside now.

## History
The development of the Starship began around 2012, although it was first mentioned by SpaceX in 2010 during a meeting at the AIAA - the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where they also revealed they would be working on bigger engines than their previous Merlin systems that powered the Falcon 1 and 9. Back then, SpaceX imagined they would plan on and develop two seperate rocket engines for the lower and upper stage of Starship. The lower one, they referenced it by the name "Merlin 2", was supposed to run on RP-1 as fuel and the upper one was actually called the Raptor engine similar to the one they developed recently but was supposed to run on LH2 (liquid hydrogen). 

As we know now and discussed earlier in the <strong>[Rocket Engines](https://guidetothegalaxy.vercel.app/documentation/aerospace_engineering/rockets/engines)</strong> section, Starship ultimately ended up using the same engine - the Raptor engine - for both the booster and the Starship itself and both of them use methane as fuel instead of RP-1 and liquid hydrogen. Actually, as you might also remember, the full flow staged combustion cycle utilized by the Raptor engine wouldn't even be possible to achieve with RP-1!
