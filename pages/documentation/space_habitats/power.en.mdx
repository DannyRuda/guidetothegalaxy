## Preface
Originally, this section wasn't planned to be included or accounted for. However, it felt ridiculous to talk about 1.200 earth-sized Space Habitats without giving a somewhat reasonable insight into their power supply. So, let's evaluate our options.

## Electritiy Generation in Space
Obviously, when we want to generate electricity from any source of energy, we would start by <strong>searching</strong> for such a source of energy. Well, we don't have to search for long because the only realistic contestant for a source of energy sufficient to supply 1.200 Space Habitats with electricity is our Sun. We won't be accounting for possible electricity generation through dark energy because this is a documentation revolving around natural sciences and not Hogwarts. 

Jokes aside, dark energy and other abstract forms of electricity generation might be exciting competition for solar energy at some point in our future but can't be taken into account for as long as we don't understand them.

The most straightforward way to generate electricity <strong>for</strong> our Space Habitats would be to apply Solar Panels to the outer layer of them. However, we're getting ourselves into a couple of issues with this approach.

### Causality dilemma
Ever heard of the <strong>["Chicken or the egg?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg)</strong> causality dilemma? It begs the question if the egg or the chicken came first, whereas both answers result in a dependency loop because both the chicken and the egg rely on each other to exist. Actually, it's pretty interesting now that we're talking about it. You might want to check it out.

Back to topic. Similarly, if we rely on solar energy generated by solar panels on the outer side of our Space Habitats, how are we going to build the first habitat? Even better so, how are we going to power all of the (probably very inefficient) machinery necessary to do the asteroid mining to even be able to reconstruct it into a Space Habitat?

### Low surface area
Not only does our torus / donut / ring (whatever you wanna call it) have a low surface area, but also due to it's form, only one side can be faced towards the Sun at a time, further limiting the amount of electricity we can generate here.

We have to come up with a concept that solves both of these issues and operates independently.

## Dyson Sphere
The Dyson Sphere is one of the most popular yet still one of the most effective ways to generate electricity from the sun. Freeman Dyson conceptualized it as a hollow sphere encapsulating the star of any given system with solar panels on the inside facing the star, so that 100% of the solar energy emitted by the internal star can be captured by the solar panels around it.

Without going into too much detail, the Dyson Sphere is a great yet ambitious concept. However, it faces a handful of problems when observed in greater detail.

### Energy storage
The sun emits an unfathomable amount of energy per any humanly conceivable timeframe and it never stops. It doesn't care for weather conditions, night and day or any other earthly factors. That being said, it's hard if not impossible for us to store all of the energy we would absorb with a Dyson Sphere like this.

### Overharvesting 
Due to AI getting better by the day right now and systems getting better with it, we will most likely do many things similarly to how we are doing them today, but with lowered energy consumption. Being able to generate electricity from 100% of the emitted solar energy of our star sounds great but would probably be unnecessary, even if we had 1.200 Space Habitats. This wouldn't be an issue if not for the previous problem, Energy Storage.

### Attraction of smaller bodies
Due to the high mass of the sun it constantly attracts smaller bodies in the solar system to fall into it. This isn't an issue for our sun at all, but considering we are planning to place a sphere all around it, said sphere would be shattered into pieces rather quickly since it would be shelled with asteroids all the time.

<strong>Long story, short:</strong> We need a better solution. How about the...

## Dyson Swarm
A Dyson Swarm is the most realistic variation of Freeman Dyson's concept. A Dyson Swarm would consists of trillions (or even more) of solar panels thrown into the sun's closer orbit to collect it's solar energy. They would essentially do the exact same thing the Dyson Sphere does, with the only difference being an on-board technology to prevent collisions both with each other and asteroids.
