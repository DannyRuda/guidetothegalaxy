## Preface
Originally, this section wasn't planned to be included or accounted for. However, it felt ridiculous to talk about 1.200 earth-sized Space Habitats without giving a somewhat reasonable insight into their power supply. So, let's evaluate our options.

## Electritiy Generation in Space
Obviously, when we want to generate electricity from any source of energy, we would start by <strong>searching</strong> for such a source of energy. Well, we don't have to search for long because the only realistic contestant for a source of energy sufficient to supply 1.200 Space Habitats with electricity is our Sun. We won't be accounting for possible electricity generation through dark energy because this is a documentation revolving around natural sciences and not Hogwarts. 

Jokes aside, dark energy and other abstract forms of electricity generation might be exciting competition for solar energy at some point in our future but can't be taken into account for as long as we don't understand them.

The most straightforward way to generate electricity <strong>for</strong> our Space Habitats would be to apply Solar Panels to the outer layer of them. However, we're getting ourselves into a couple of issues with this approach.

### Causality dilemma
Ever heard of the <strong>["Chicken or the egg?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg)</strong> causality dilemma? It begs the question if the egg or the chicken came first, whereas both answers result in a dependency loop because both the chicken and the egg rely on each others to exist. Actually, it's pretty interesting now that we're talking about it. You might want to check it out.

Back to topic. Similarly, if we rely on solar energy generated by solar panels on the outer side of our Space Habitats, how are we going to build the first habitat? Even better so, how are we going to power all of the (probably very inefficient) machinery necessary to do the asteroid mining to even be able to reconstruct it into a Space Habitat?

### Low surface area
Not only does our torus / donut / ring (whatever you wanna call it) have a low surface area, but also due to it's form, only one side can be faced towards the Sun at a time, further limiting the amount of electricity we can generate here.

We have to come up with a concept that solves both of these issues and operates independently.
