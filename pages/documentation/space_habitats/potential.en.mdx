## Material Cost

After we now solved the "How?", let's start thinking more practically. Does the asteroid belt even contain enough asteroids for us to build Space Habs out of them? Before breaking down the answer to this question, let's guess. What do you think? 

How big of a diameter does an asteroid need to have for us to be able to build a Space Habitat the same land mass as the earth out of it's containing materials?

Think about it for a second before revealing the answer if you like ðŸ¤”.
